##### Euler_025
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) where F(1) = 1 and F(2) = 1

Hence the first 12 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144
The 12th term, F(12), is the first term to contain three digits.
What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain N digits?

##### Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, i.e., number of test cases.
Next T lines will contain an integer N.

##### Constraints

1 <= T <= 5000
2 <= N <= 5000

##### Output Format

Print the values corresponding to each test case.
