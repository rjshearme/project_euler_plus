##### Euler_028
Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

21 22 23 24 25
20  7  8  9 10
19  6  1  2 11
18  5  4  3 12
17 16 15 14 13

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.
What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a N x N, (N is odd) spiral formed in the same way?

As the sum will be huge you have to print the result mod (10e9 + 7)

##### Input Format

The first line contains an integer  T, i.e., number of test cases.
Next T lines will contain an integer N.

##### Constraints

1 <= T <= 10e5
1 <= N <= 10e18, N is odd

##### Output Format

Print the values corresponding to each test case.
