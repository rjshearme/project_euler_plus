##### Euler_009
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which, a^2 + b^2 = c^2

For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2

Given N, check if there exists any Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = N
Find maximum possible value of abc among all such Pythagorean triplets, If there is no such Pythagorean triplet print -1.
