## Solutions to Project Euler 1 - 30

This repository contains Python solutions to all of the first 30 ProjectEuler+ problems from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges).
These problems should provide evidence for computational and mathematical ability.

These problems are more challenging than the standard ones on projecteuler.net for three reasons.

1. These problems have larger limits than the original problems
2. These problems generally must be programatically solved for T test cases instead of 1 like in the original problems
3. These problems must complete within strict time limits

### Running the solutions

All the scripts read from STDIN and output to STDOUT. They will expect inputs as specified in the README for each problem.

Python3 is required to run the Python solutions but no non-standard-library packages are used so no virtual environment is required.

The GHC is required to compile the Haskell solutions and they can be run directly after.
