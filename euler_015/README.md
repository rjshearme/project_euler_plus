##### Euler_015
Starting in the top left corner of a 2 x 2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through an N x M grid? As number of ways can be very large, print it modulo (10e9 + 7).

##### Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, i.e., number of test cases.
Next T lines will contain integers N and M.

##### Constraints

1 <= T <= 10e3

1 <= N <= 500

1 <= M <= 500

##### Output Format

Print the values corresponding to each test case.
