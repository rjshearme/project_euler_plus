##### Euler_027
Euler published the remarkable quadratic formula: n^2 + n + 41
It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive values n=0 to 39. However, when n=40, the value is divisible by 41, and certainly when n=41, the value is clearly divisible by 41.

Using computers, the incredible formula n^2 -79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values n=0 to 79. The product of the coefficients, -79 and 1601, is -126479.

Considering quadratics of the form:

n^2 + an + b, where |a|, |b| <=N

Find the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n=0.

Note For this challenge you can assume solution to be unique.
